  <h2>Hi there, I'm Steve!</h2>
</div>

I enjoy working on websites and coming up with solutions that really satisfy clients, preferably while sipping on some black coffee.

When not coding, I'm likely to be watching various content on YouTube while high alching at the Grand Exchange on Old School Runescape, or on the look for any cute cats to photograph while outside.

I'm currently:

- :computer: developing Wheat, an app where users can list ingredients they have and find others to cook together with
- :briefcase: working as an executive assistant for [Chris'Gallery](https://chrisgallery.org/)
- :package: working as a packaging assistant for SlimeSweetPea
